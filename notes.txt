These are all seat joints, except for 35a1, which is a problem because the TMAM fails to solve it.

The 35a1 shape has two 3-layer half-logos (with hat).  The TMAM picks the wrong one.
The TMAM picks in this order: ESWN
- 0121 is East
- 0181 is North

Rotating right once puts the good half-logo on the East, and that shape works.

Also need a way to fix the problem shape.

Picking last logo

Only seat joints left.  I think that means there are no other ambiguous shapes.
But need to try all shapes to be sure.

NOT FOUND 35a1

The "special case" must be seat joints.
But adding support for pad, and looking for them first, causes other shapes to fail.

Need a "smart" way to find seat joints.

Much better.
1634 - one 3-pad, one 3-logo.  The first has a pad, but then fails because the second has no pad.
1bc1 - one 3-pad, then two 2-logo, picks the wrong one.
35a1 - problem shape - two 3-hat, picks the wrong one.

Test having a pad optional.

1634 works now.
